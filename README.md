.NETpad 3.2 for Windows 11 is a work-in-progress update to [.NETpad 3](https://github.com/thurrott/DotNetPad3), a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) version of .NETpad that adds support for Windows 11 theming.

Initial version includes 

- Several months of code refactoring but might still be rough around the edges. There are new clases for app settings, app state, and document (which includes file operations now).
- Find/replace has been reimplemented as a UserControl. I am looking at reimplementing Setting similarly.
- A new "document needs to be saved" indicator in the menu bar uses data-binding to stay up-to-date.
- I've started building out the text box context menu with more options.
- I'm experimenting with different icon designs

More soon.
